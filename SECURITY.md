# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The `main` branch is the active development line. Security fixes will be applied there. Releases, if any, will be called out in tags.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for suspected security problems. Instead:

- Email maintainer with details, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.
- If you can, include a minimal proof of concept.
- You can also submit a private advisory using GitHub Security Advisories.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide an initial assessment or fix plan shortly after.

## Safe disclosure guidelines

- Do not exploit the vulnerability or access data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.
- Do not publicly disclose until a fix is available and users have had a reasonable time to update.
